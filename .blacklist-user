# This file can be used in conjunction with hooks.py:check_user_blacklist
# to blacklist certain usernames. To blacklist a username, add it all by
# itself on a line below.


# Blacklist the example used in the SVG WG wiki's "Mercurial" page:

user <email>


# Blacklist my normal hg username (which is my personal email address),
# since I should be using my official work email address for commits
# to SVG WG repositories:

Jonathan Watt <jwatt@jwatt.org>
