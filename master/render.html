<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Implementations of SVG are expected to behave as though they
implement a rendering (or imaging) model corresponding to the
one described in this chapter. <span class="ready-for-wg-review">
Real implementations may choose to implement the model in the way
that they see fit, but the result on any device supported by the
implementation must, in most cases, match this model.</span></p>

<p>The appendix on <a href="conform.html">conformance
requirements</a> describes the extent to which an actual
implementation may deviate from this description. In practice
an actual implementation <span class="ready-for-wg-review">may</span>
deviate slightly because of
limitations of the output device (e.g. only a limited range of
colors might be supported) and because of practical limitations
in implementing a precise mathematical model (e.g. for
realistic performance curves are approximated by straight
lines, the approximation need only be sufficiently precise to
match the conformance requirements).</p>

<h2 id="PaintersModel">The painters model</h2>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">

<p>SVG uses a "painters model" of rendering. <a>Paint</a>
is applied in successive operations to the output device such
that each operation paints onto some area of the output device,
possibly obscuring paint that has previously been layed down.

After each object or group is painted, it becomes part of the background
for the next painting operation.

SVG 2 supports advanced blending modes and compositing operations that
control how each painting operation interacts with the background.
The rules governing these painting operations are outlined in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing/">Compositing and Blending Specification</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="RenderingOrder">Rendering order</h2>
<p>
<span class="ready-for-wg-review">
Elements in SVG are positioned in three dimensions. In addition to their
position on the x and y axis of the <a>viewport</a>, SVG elements are also
positioned on the z-axis. The position on the z-axis defines the order that 
they are painted.
<br/><br/>
Along the z-axis, elements are grouped into 'stacking contexts', each stacking
context has an associated stack level.
A stack level may contain one or more child nodes - either child
stack levels, <a>graphics elements</a>, or <a>'g'</a> elements.
<a>Graphics elements</a> and <a>'g'</a> elements within single
stack level are painted in document order - that is, they are painted
in the order that they are defined in the document.
<br/><br/>
Each stack level is assigned an integer value that defines it's
position on the z-axis relative to other stack levels within the same
stacking context. Lower values are painted first, and so
elements in a stack level with a higher value will paint over one 
with a lower value.
<br/><br/>
By default, everything is placed in stack level zero.
</span>
</p>

<h3 id="ZIndexProperty">Controlling element rendering order: the <span class='property'>'z-index'</span> property</h3>

<p class="note">See the CSS 2.1 specification for the definition
of <a>'z-index'</a>. [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>]</p>

<p>The <a>'z-index'</a> property allows an element to be assigned to a 
stack level.
</p>

<p class="ready-for-wg-review">
The rules governing behaviour for SVG elements with the <a>'z-index'</a>
property specified are outlined below:
</p>

<p class="note">CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-z-index">specifies</a> a
property named <a>'z-index'</a>.  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">CSS rules
that define the effect of the <span class='property'>'z-index'</span> property</a>
were written specifically for the CSS box model, and those rules do not make
sense as they stand for most SVG elements (most SVG elements do not participate
in or establish a CSS box model layout).  This section specifies how
implementations must handle the <a>'z-index'</a> property on elements in the SVG
namespace.</p>

<p>Contrary to the rules in CSS 2.1, the <a>'z-index'</a> property applies to all SVG
elements regardless of the value of the <a>'position'</a> property, with one exception:
as for boxes in CSS 2.1, outer <a>'svg'</a> elements must be positioned for <a>'z-index'</a>
to apply to them.</p>

<p>The <a>'z-index'</a> property specifies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The stack level of the element in the current stacking context.</li>
  <li>Whether the element establishes a new local stacking context.</li>
</ol>

<p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>&lt;integer&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This integer is the stack level of the element in the current
  stacking context. The element also establishes a new local
  stacking context for its descendants.</dd>

  <dt>auto</dt>
  <dd>The stack level of the element in the current stacking context
  is the same as its parent element, unless its parent established
  a new stacking context, in which case its stack level is 0. The
  element does not establish a new local stacking context.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
  <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
  <pre>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;rect x="0"  width="100" height="100" fill="red"    z-index="-1"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="40" width="100" height="100" fill="lime"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="80" width="100" height="100" fill="blue"   z-index="1"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="60" width="100" height="100" fill="aqua"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="20" width="100" height="100" fill="yellow" z-index="-1"/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>
  <p>In this example there are three stack levels: -1, 0 (the default) and 1. The red
  and yellow rects are in stack level -1, the lime and aqua rects are in stack
  level 0 (the default), and the blue rect is in stack level 1. Going from lowest
  stack level to highest, and painting the elements in each stack level in
  document order, the painting order is: red, yellow, lime, aqua, blue.</p>
</div>

<p>A new stacking context must be established at an SVG element for its descendants if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it is the root element</li>

  <li>the <a>'z-index'</a> property applies to the element and its computed
   value is an integer</li>

  <li>the element is an <a>outermost svg element</a>, or a <a>'foreignObject'</a>,
  <a>'image'</a>, <a>'marker element'</a>, <a>'mask element'</a>, <a>'pattern'</a>,
  <a>'symbol'</a> or <a>'use'</a> element</li>

  <li>the element is an inner <a>'svg'</a> element and the computed value of its
  <a>'overflow'</a> property is a value other than <span class='prop-value'>visible</span></li>

  <li>the element is subject to explicit clipping:
    <ul>
      <li>the <a>'clip'</a> property applies to the element and it has a
      computed value other than <span class='prop-value'>auto</span></li>

      <li>the <a>'clip-path'</a> property applies to the element and it has a
      computed value other than <span class='prop-value'>none</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>the <a>'opacity'</a> property applies to the element and it has a
  computed value other than <span class='prop-value'>1</span></li>

  <li>the <a>'mask property'</a> property applies to the element and it has a computed
  value other than <span class='prop-value'>none</span></li>

  <li>the <a>'filter property'</a> property applies to the element and it has a
  computed value other than <span class='prop-value'>none</span></li>

  <li class="ready-for-wg-review">a property defined in another specification is
  applied and that property is defined to establish a stacking context in SVG</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>For a user friendly explanation of the terms "stack level" and "stacking
context", see the z-index primer document. For the normative rules regarding how
stacking contexts and stack levels affect SVG elements, see below.</p>
-->

<p>Stacking contexts and stack levels are conceptual tools used to describe the
order in which elements must be painted one on top of the other when the
document is rendered, and for determining which element is highest when
determining the target of a pointer event. Stacking contexts and stack levels do
not affect the position of elements in the DOM tree, and their presence or
absence does not affect an element's position, size or orientation in the
canvas' X-Y plane - only the order in which it is painted.</p>

<p>Stacking contexts can contain further stacking contexts. A stacking context is
atomic from the point of view of its parent stacking context; elements in
ancestor stacking contexts may not come between any of its elements.</p>

<p>Each element belongs to one stacking context. Each element in a given stacking
context has an integer stack level. Elements with a higher stack level must be
placed in front of elements with lower stack levels in the same stacking
context. Elements may have negative stack levels. Elements with the same stack
level in a stacking context must be stacked according to document order.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <a>'foreignObject'</a> element, the back to front
stacking order for a stacking context created by an SVG element is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the background and borders of the element forming the stacking
  context, if any</li>

  <li>child stacking contexts created by descendants with negative stack
  levels, primarily ordered by most negative first, then by tree order</li>

  <li>descendants with <span class='prop-value'>'z-index: auto'</span> or
  <span class='prop-value'>'z-index: 0'</span>, in tree order</li>

  <li>child stacking contexts created by descendants with positive stack levels,
  primarily ordered by lowest index first, then by tree order</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the <a>'foreignObject'</a> element creates a "fixed position containing block" in
CSS terms, the normative rules for the stacking order of the stacking context
created by <a>'foreignObject'</a> elements are the rules in Appendix E of CSS 2.1.</p>

<div class="example">
  <p>In the following example, the <a>'z-index'</a> property on the <a>'g'</a>
  element is set to zero. This creates a new stacking context to contain the
  <a>'g'</a> element's children without moving the <a>'g'</a> to a different
  level in the document's root stacking context:</p>
  <pre>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
  &lt;g z-index="0"&gt;
    &lt;!-- this is a self contained graphic --&gt;
    &lt;rect x="40" width="100" height="100" fill="lime" z-index="1"/&gt;
    &lt;rect x="20" width="100" height="100" fill="yellow"/&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;rect x="60" width="100" height="100" fill="aqua"/&gt;
  &lt;rect x="0" width="100" height="100" fill="red" z-index="-1"/&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre>

  <p>The example's root stacking context contains two stack levels: -1 and 0. The red
  <a>'rect'</a> is in level -1, and the <a>'g'</a> element and aqua <a>'rect'</a> are in level 0. Inside
  stack level 0, the <a>'g'</a> element's <a>'z-index'</a> property creates a new nested stacking
  context at the <a>'g'</a> for the <a>'g'</a> element's children. In this child stacking
  context there are two stack levels: 0 and 1. The yellow <a>'rect'</a> is in level 0 (the
  default), and the lime <a>'rect'</a> is in level 1.</p>

  <p>Painting of this example starts with the stack levels of the root stacking
  context. First the red rect is painted in level -1, then in level 0 the <a>'g'</a>
  element is painted followed by the aqua rect. When the <a>'g'</a> element is painted,
  the child stacking context that its z-index created and all of that context's
  stack levels are also painted. In this child stacking context, first the yellow
  rect in level 0 is painted, followed by the lime rect in level 1. It's only
  after the <a>'g'</a> and the stacking context that it creates has been painted that the
  aqua rect is painted. Note that this means that although the z-index of 1 for
  the lime rect is a higher value than the (implicit) z-index of 0 for the aqua
  rect, the containment provided by the <a>'g'</a>'s child stacking context results in the
  aqua rect painting over the lime rect. The painting order is therefore: red,
  yellow, lime, aqua.</p>

<h2 id="Grouping">How groups are rendered</h2>

<p>
Grouping elements, such as the <a>'g'</a> element (see <a>container elements</a>

masking and object opacity</a> settings on the graphics
element.
</p>
<p class="issue" data-issue="3">Should this mention blending as well?</p>
</div>

<h2 id="TypesOfGraphicsElements">Types of graphics elements</h2>

<p>SVG supports three fundamental types of <a>graphics elements</a>
that can be rendered onto the canvas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a>Shapes</a>, which represent some combination of straight line
  and curves</li>
  <li>Text, which represents some combination of character glyphs</li>
  <li>Raster images, which represent an array of values that
  specify the paint color and opacity (often termed alpha) at a
  series of points on a rectangular grid. (SVG requires support
  for specified raster image formats under
  <a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="PaintingShapesAndText">Painting shapes and text</h3>

<p>Shapes and text can be <a>filled</a> (i.e., apply paint to the
interior of the shape) and <a>stroked</a> (i.e., apply paint
along the outline of the shape). A stroke operation is centered
on the outline of the object; thus, in effect, half of the
paint falls on the interior of the shape and half of the paint
falls outside of the shape.</p>

<p>For certain types of shapes, <a href="painting.html#Markers">marker
symbols</a> (which themselves can consist of any combination of shapes,
text and images) can be drawn at selected vertices. Each marker symbol
is painted as if its graphical content were expanded into the
SVG document tree just after the shape object which is using
the given marker symbol. The graphical contents of a marker
symbol are rendered using the same methods as graphics
elements. Marker symbols are not applicable to text.</p>

<p>The order in which fill, stroke and markers are painted is determined
by the <a>'paint-order'</a> property. The default is that 
fill is painted first, then the stroke, and then the
marker symbols. The marker symbols are rendered in order along
the outline of the shape, from the start of the shape to the
end of the shape.</p>

<p>Each fill and stroke operation has its own opacity settings;
thus, you can fill and/or stroke a shape with a
semi-transparently drawn solid color, with different opacity
values for the fill and stroke operations.</p>

<p>The fill and stroke operations are entirely independent
painting operations; thus, if you both fill and stroke a shape,
half of the stroke will be painted on top of part of the
fill.</p>

<p>SVG supports the following built-in types of paint which can
be used in fill and stroke operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/">solid color</a></li>
  <li><a href="pservers.html#Gradients">gradients</a> (linear and radial)</li>
  <li><a href="pservers.html#Patterns">patterns</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="issue" data-issue="4">Mention hatches, mesh gradients?</p>

<h3 id="PaintingRasterImages">Painting raster images</h3>

<p>When a raster image is rendered, the original samples are
"resampled" using standard algorithms to produce samples at the
positions required on the output device. Resampling
requirements are discussed under
<a href="conform.html">conformance requirements</a>.</p>

<p class="issue" data-issue="5">Should we mention anything regarding animated images?</p>

<h2 id="FilteringPaintRegions">Filtering painted regions</h2>

<div class="issue" data-issue="6">
    This section needs more detail on the interaction between compositing and blending and filter effects.
    Waiting on the Compositing and Blending spec to define the accumulated background removal process.
    Filtering will need to fit into that process as the final step before the group buffer is composited with the page.
</div>

<p>SVG allows any painting operation to be filtered. (See
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a>.)</p>

<p>In this case the result must be as though the paint
operations had been applied to an intermediate canvas
initialized to transparent black, of a size determined by the
rules given in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a> then
filtered by the processes defined in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/">Filter Effects</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ClippingMaskingObjectOpacity">Clipping, masking and object opacity</h2>

<p>SVG allows any painting operation to be limited to a
subregion of the output device by clipping and masking. This is
described in <a href="masking.html">Clipping, Masking and
Compositing</a>.</p>
<div class="issue" data-issue="7">Need to remove reference to compositing in the Clipping, Masking and Compositing chapter.</div>

<p>Clipping uses a path to define a region of the output device
to which paint can be applied. Any painting operation executed
within the scope of the clipping must be rendered such that
only those parts of the device that fall within the clipping
region are affected by the painting operation. A <a>clipping path</a>
can be thought of as a mask wherein those pixels outside the
clipping path are black with an alpha value of zero and those
pixels inside the clipping path are white with an alpha value
of one. "Within" is defined by the same rules used to determine
the interior of a path for painting. The clipping path is
typically anti-aliased on low-resolution devices (see
<a>'shape-rendering'</a>. Clipping is
described in
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/css-masking-1/index.html#clipping-paths">Clipping paths</a>
from <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/css-masking-1/index.html#clipping-paths"><cite>CSS Masking</cite></a>
([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS-MASKING">CSS-MASKING</a>], section 8).</p>

<div class="ready-for-wider-review">
<p>Masking uses the luminance of the color channels and alpha
channel in a referenced SVG element to define a supplemental
set of alpha values which are multiplied to the alpha values
already present in the graphics to which the mask is applied.
The resulting alpha value is used as input to the Compositing
and Blending operations described in the Compositing and Blending Specification [<a href="refs.html#ref-COMPOSITINGBLENDING">COMPOSITING-BLENDING</a>].
Masking is described in detail in
<a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/default/css-masking-1/index.html"><cite>CSS Masking</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS-MASKING">CSS-MASKING</a>].</p>

<p>A supplemental masking operation may also be specified by
applying a "global" opacity to a set of rendering operations.
In this case the mask is infinite, with a color of white and an
alpha channel of the given opacity value. (See the <a>'opacity'</a>
property.)</p>
</div>

<h2 id="ParentCompositing">Parent Compositing</h2>

<p>SVG document fragments can be semi-opaque. In many
environments (e.g., Web browsers), the SVG document fragment
has a final compositing step where the document as a whole is
blended translucently into the background canvas.</p>
