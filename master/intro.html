<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="AboutSVG">About SVG</h2>

<p>This specification defines the features and syntax for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</a>.</p>

<p>SVG is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics.
As a standalone format or when mixed with other XML, it uses the
XML syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-XML10">XML10</a>].
When mixed with HTML5, it uses the HTML5 syntax [<a href="refs.html#ref-HTML">HTML</a>].
SVG allows for three types of graphic objects: vector graphic
shapes (e.g., paths consisting of straight lines and curves),
images and text. Graphical objects can be grouped, styled,
transformed and composited into previously rendered objects.
The feature set includes nested transformations, clipping
paths, alpha masks, filter effects and template objects.</p>

<p>SVG drawings can be <a href="interact.html">interactive</a>
and <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">dynamic</a>. <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">Animations</a>
can be defined and triggered
either declaratively (i.e., by embedding SVG animation elements
in SVG content) or via scripting.</p>

<p>Sophisticated applications of SVG are possible by use of a
supplemental scripting language which accesses
<a href="svgdom.html">SVG Document Object Model (DOM)</a>, which
provides complete access to all elements, attributes and
properties. A rich set of <a href="interact.html#SVGEvents">event handlers</a>
such as <a>'onmouseover'</a> and <a>'onclick'</a> can be assigned to any SVG
graphical object.
Because of its <a href="intro.html#W3CCompatibility">compatibility and
leveraging of other Web standards</a>, features like
<a href="interact.html">scripting</a> can be done on HTML and SVG
elements simultaneously within the same Web page.</p>

<p>SVG is a language for rich graphical content. For
accessibility reasons, if there is an original source document
containing higher-level structure and semantics, it is
recommended that the higher-level information be made available
somehow, either by making the original source document
available, or making an alternative version available in an
alternative format which conveys the higher-level information,
or by using SVG's facilities to include the higher-level
information within the SVG content. For suggested techniques in
achieving greater accessibility, see
<a href="access.html">Accessibility</a>.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="MIMEType">SVG MIME type and file name extensions</h2>

<p>The MIME type for SVG is "<code>image/svg+xml</code>" (see
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#image"><cite>IANA Media Type Registry</cite></a>).</p>

<p>It is recommended that SVG files have the extension
<code>".svg"</code> (all lowercase) on all platforms. It is
recommended that <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">gzip-compressed</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC1952">RFC1952</a>]
SVG files have the extension <code>".svgz"</code> (all
lowercase) on all platforms.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2 id="Namespace">SVG namespace and DTD</h2>

<p>The SVG 2 namespace is <code>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</code>,
which is the same as for earlier versions of SVG.</p>
<p>When using the XML syntax, a namespace declaration is required. When
using the HTML syntax, the namespace is provided automatically by the parser.</p>

<p>A DTD is not provided in this specification, as the use of DTDs for
validating documents is known to be problematic.  In particular, DTDs
do not handle namespaces gracefully and the range of constraints they can express is limited.  It is recommended that authors
<em>do not include</em> a DOCTYPE declaration in SVG documents.</p>

<h2 id="W3CCompatibility">Compatibility with other standards efforts</h2>

<p>SVG leverages and integrates with other W3C specifications
and standards efforts, as described in the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SVG can be integrated with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML</a> either by using SVG in HTML or by using HTML in SVG, in both cases either by inclusion or reference. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/svg-integration/">SVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG is an application of XML and is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/">XML 1.0</a> and with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">Namespaces in XML</a> specification. However, when SVG content is included in HTML document, the HTML syntax applies and may not be compatible with XML. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/svg-integration/">SVG Integration</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG content is styled with CSS. See <a href="styling.html#StylingWithCSS">Styling with CSS</a> for details.</li>

  <li>SVG includes a complete Document Object Model (DOM) and
  extends <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/"><cite>DOM4</cite></a>.
  The SVG DOM has a high level of compatibility and consistency
  with the HTML DOM that is defined in the DOM Level 1
  specification. Additionally, the SVG DOM supports and
  incorporates many of the facilities described in
  DOM Level 2 and 3, including the CSS object model and event
  handling
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM2STYLE">DOM2STYLE</a>]
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-DOM3EVENTS">DOM3EVENTS</a>].
  <p class="issue" data-issue="1">Clarify what DOM version is used and indicate that SVG/HTML can be scripted with a single API.</p>
  </li>

  <li>SVG incorporates some features and approaches that are
  part of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SMIL3-20081201/">SMIL 3</a>, including
  the <a>'switch'</a> element and the <a>'systemLanguage'</a>
  attribute.</li>

  <li>SVG's <a href="https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/">animation</a> features incorporate and extend the general-purpose
  animation capabilities described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-smil-animation-20010904/"><cite>SMIL Animation</cite></a>.
  <p class="issue" data-issue="2"> Reference Web Animations instead?</p>
  </li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with W3C work on internationalization.
  References (W3C and otherwise) include: [<a
  href="refs.html#ref-UNICODE">UNICODE</a>]
  and [<a href="refs.html#ref-CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a>].</li>

  <li>SVG is compatible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/">W3C work on Web Accessibility</a>.
  Also, see <a href="access.html">Accessibility Support</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Within this specification, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
"REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
described in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"><cite>Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</cite></a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>].
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all
uppercase letters in this specification.</p>

<p>At times, this specification recommends good practice for
authors and user agents. These recommendations are not
normative and conformance with this specification does not
depend on their realization. These recommendations contain the
expression "We recommend ...", "This specification recommends
...", or some similar wording.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Definitions" class="needs-work">Definitions</h2>

<p class="issue" data-issue="3">There should be a separate section that lists
element and attribute categories and their members.</p>

<dl class='definitions'  data-dfn-type="dfn" data-export="">

  <dt id="TermCircularReference">circular reference</dt>
  <dd><a href="intro.html#TermURLReference">URL references</a> that directly or indirectly reference 
  themselves are treated as invalid circular references.</dd>

  <dt id="TermInvalidReference">invalid reference</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="intro.html#TermURLReference">URL reference</a> to node that do not exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="intro.html#TermURLReference">URL references</a> to elements which are
        inappropriate targets for the given reference shall be treated as invalid
        references (see <a href="linking.html#processingURL">Processing of URL references</a>
        for appropriate targets).
        For example, the <a>'clip-path'</a> property can only refer to
        <a>'clipPath'</a> elements. The property setting
        <span class="attr-value">clip-path:url(#MyElement)</span> is an
        invalid reference if the referenced element is not a <a>'clipPath'</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt id="TermInvalidValue">invalid value</dt>
  <dd>An invalid value specified for a <a>property</a>, either in a style sheet
  or a <a>presentation attribute</a>, is one that is either not allowed according
  to the grammar defining the property's values, or is allowed by the grammar but
  subsequently disallowed in prose.  A CSS declaration with an invalid value is
  ignored; see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/syndata.html#declaration">Declarations
  and properties</a> ([<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>], section 4.1.8).</dd>

  <dt id="TermInitialValue">initial value</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A initial value is a defined behavior used when an attribute or
      property is not specified, or when an attribute or property has an
      unsupported value.
      This value is to be used for the purposes of rendering, calculating
      animation values, and when accessing the attribute or property.  As
      opposed to an XML default value, however, the attribute
      or property and its value are not visible in the DOM, and cannot be
      accessed with DOM methods.
      For properties, if the property is inherited and
      there is no inherited value (for example, on the root element), the
      initial value is the initial value
      as specified in the definition of that property.
      For non-inherited properties, the initial value is always the initial value.
    </p>
    <p class="issue" data-issue="8">"Unsupported value" should be a term that is linked to.</p>
    <p>
      Note that a initial value is distinct from the XML term
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#dt-default">default value</a>,
      which uses DTD lookup to determine whether an attribute is required
      and what its value is, and inserts required attributes and their
      values into the DOM
      ([<a href="refs.html#ref-XML10">XML10</a>], section 3.3.2).
      At the XML parser level, SVG Tiny 1.2 does not have default values;
      initiale are part of the SVG application layer, and their values are
      derived from the UA.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="TermLocalURLReference">local URL reference</dt>
  <dd>An Internationalized Resource Identifier [<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC3987">RFC3987</a>] that does
  not include an <span class="code-fragment">&lt;absoluteURL&gt;</span> or
  <span class="code-fragment">&lt;relativeURL&gt;</span> and thus
  represents a reference to an element within the current
  document. See <a href="struct.html#Head">References and the
  <span class="element-name">'defs'</span> element</a>.<p class="issue" data-issue="4">Unify this with other specifiction defintions of URL</p></dd>

  <dt id="TermMarkableElement">markable element</dt>
  <dd>A markable element is one that can have <a href="painting.html#Markers">markers</a>
  painted on it either through the use of the <a href="painting.html#TermMarkerProperties">marker properties</a>
  or by having a <a>'marker element'</a> element as a child.
  The following elements are markable elements:
  <edit:elementcategory name='markable'/></dd>

  <dt id="TermNonLocalURLReference">non-local URL reference</dt>
  <dd>An Internationalized Resource Identifier [<a href="refs.html#ref-RFC3987">RFC3987</a>] that
  includes an <span class="code-fragment">&lt;absoluteURL&gt;</span> or
  <span class="code-fragment">&lt;relativeURL&gt;</span> and thus
  (usually) represents a reference to a different document or
  an element within a different document. See
  <a href="struct.html#Head">References and the
  <span class="element-name">'defs'</span> element</a>.<p class="issue" data-issue="5">Unify this with other specifiction defintions of URL. But see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/references.html#refsURL">HTML5 refs section on URL</a>
  which is complex.</p></dd>

  <dt id="TermPresentationAttribute">presentation attribute</dt>
  <dd>An attribute on an SVG element which specifies a
  value for a given <a>property</a>
  for that element.

  See <a href="styling.html">Styling</a>. Note that
  although any property may be <em>specified</em> on any element,
  not all properties will <em>apply to</em> (affect the rendering of)
  a given element. The definition of each property states to what set
  of elements it applies.</dd>

  <dt id="TermProperty">property</dt>
  <dd>A parameter that helps specify how a document should be
  rendered. A complete list of SVG's properties can be found in
  <a href="propidx.html">Property Index</a>. Properties are
  assigned to elements in the SVG language either by
  <a>presentation attributes</a>
  on elements in the SVG language or by using a styling language such as CSS
  [<a href="refs.html#ref-CSS21">CSS21</a>]. See
  <a href="styling.html">Styling</a>.</dd>

  <dt id="TermStructuralElement"><dfn>structural element</dfn></dt>
  <dd>The structural elements are those which define the primary
  structure of an SVG document.  Specifically, the following
  elements are structural elements:
  <edit:elementcategory name='structural'/>.</dd>

  <dt id="TermStructurallyExternalElement">structurally external element</dt>
  <dd>Elements that define its structure by reference to an external resource.
  Specifically, the following elements are structurally external elements when
  they have an <span class="attr-name">'href'</span> attribute:
  <edit:elementcategory name='structurally external'/>.</dd>

  <dt id="TermSVGUserAgent">SVG user agent</dt>
  <dd>An SVG user agent is a <a>user agent</a> that is able to retrieve and
  render SVG content.</dd>

    <dt id="TermURLReference">URL reference</dt>
  <dd>An URL reference is an Internationalized Resource Identifier
  with an optional fragment identifier, as defined in
  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt"><cite>Internationalized Resource Identifiers</cite></a>
  [<a href='refs.html#ref-RFC3987'>RFC3987</a>].
  An URL reference serves as a reference to a resource or (with a
  fragment identifier) to a secondary resource. See
  <a href="linking.html#URLReference">References</a> and
  <a href="struct.html#Head">References and the
  <span class="element-name">'defs'</span> element</a>.</dd>

  <dt id="TermUserAgent">user agent</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>The general definition of a user agent is an application
    that retrieves and renders Web content, including text,
    graphics, sounds, video, images, and other content types. A
    user agent may require additional user agents that handle
    some types of content. For instance, a browser may run a
    separate program or plug-in to render sound or video. User
    agents include graphical desktop browsers, multimedia
    players, text browsers, voice browsers, and assistive
    technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers,
    speech synthesizers, onscreen keyboards, and voice input
    software.</p>

    <p>A "user agent" may or may not have the ability to retrieve
    and render SVG content; however, an "SVG user agent"
    retrieves and renders SVG content.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="TermWhiteSpaceCharacter">white space characters</dt>
  <dd>The following characters are considered white space characters:
  U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION,
  U+000C FORM FEED (FF),
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR),
  U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and
  U+0020 SPACE.</dd>
