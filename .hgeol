# This file is used by the 'eol' extension. The eol extension helps prevent
# users from checking in changes where they inadvertently change the line
# endings of a file (and thereby trash the diff and hg blame/annotate). It
# also lets users work with files using their OS's native line endings.
#
# IMPORTANT: each user of this repository must enable the eol extension before
# they make and commit any changes (unless they /really/ know what they're
# doing)! Failure to enable the extension may mean that your changes will
# contain the wrong line endings, in which case the central repository will
# block your pushes until you manually fix the line endings in your changesets.
# Read the section on enabling the extension here (and pay attention to its
# "IMPORTANT" subsection):
#
#   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/EolExtension






#               !!!! WARNING! WARNING! WATCH OUT! !!!!
#
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE "IMPORTANT"
# SUBSECTIONS IN THE SECTION ABOUT CHANGING A ".hgeol" FILE ON THE PAGE:
#
#   http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/EolExtension
#
# Changing this file can cause "unexpected" changes to appear for files that
# you DID NOT TOUCH. That's probably okay, but pushing your changes to /this/
# file without first resolving any such "unexpected" changes is definitely NOT.
# Doing so will cause those "unexpected" changes to appear in other users'
# working directories as UNCOMMITTED(!!) changes, which will really confuse and
# annoy them! Read the appropriate IMPORTANT sections on the page linked above
# and this will all make sense!






[repository]

# Repository's native EOL type:

native = LF

[eol]

# TODO: this doesn't seem to have any affect here, so users probably need to
# add this to their own Mercurial config.
#
# Tell the eol extension to do its thing on files matching patterns of type
# 'native' even if they contain inconsistent line endings. (Any files that
# intentionally contain a mixture of line ending characters should be marked
# as 'BIN' (not 'native') to tell the eol extension to leave them alone.)

only-consistent = False
